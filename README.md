## 🌟 Overview

**AniXFlix** is a state-of-the-art, high-performance streaming directory built with **Next.js App Router**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

It has two catalog worlds:

- 🎬 **Movies & TV** — metadata from the **TMDB API**, playback via curated third-party embed servers.
- 🎌 **Anime** — metadata from **AniList**, streaming sources aggregated by the built-in **`anixanime`** provider layer (12 providers), served through Next.js API routes with an HLS proxy.

> **Note:** AniXFlix is an indexer. It does **not** host, store, or stream any media files on its own servers.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Premium Aesthetic**: Glassmorphism, dynamic gradients, micro-animations, and a responsive layout from mobile to 4K TVs.
- 🎬 **Movies & TV Catalog**: Trending, popular, top-rated, cast details, similar content, and season/episode browsing powered by TMDB.
- 🎌 **Anime Catalog**: AniList-powered discovery with episode lists, SUB/DUB toggle, and multi-provider failover (ReAnime, AniKoto, AnimeGG, AniNeko, AniBD + more).
- ⚡ **Dynamic Image Proxy**: The `/api/images/[type]/[id]` route resolves titled English backdrops from TMDB on the fly via cache-controlled `302 Redirects` — fast loads, no rate-limit pressure, no UI flashes.
- 📡 **HLS Proxy**: The `/api/anixanime/proxy` route rewrites HLS playlists/keys and subtitles so streams play in-browser with one custom player.
- 🖥️ **Multi-Server Players**: One-tap server switching for both movies/TV (`components/player`) and anime (`AniXAnimePlayer` + `AniXCustomPlayer`).
- 💾 **Local-First State**: Watchlist, history, and continue-watching in Zustand + LocalStorage. Your data never leaves your device.
- 🔍 **Global Search**: Instant debounced search modal across movies, TV, and anime.
- 📱 **Mobile Optimized & APK Ready**: Responsive design plus a Flutter WebView wrapper in `AniXFlixApk/` (Android).

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Lucide icons
- **State**: Zustand (persisted) for watchlist, history, and continue-watching
- **Data Sources**: TMDB (movies/TV), AniList (anime metadata), `anixanime` scrapers (anime streams)

### How Playback Works

```text
Movies/TV page  →  TMDB metadata  →  embed server iframe (AnixHub, RozgarLelo, …)
Anime watch page → /api/anixanime/episodes|watch → anixanime providers → HLS via /api/anixanime/proxy
```

### Private Servers (local only)

Movie-server code that must **not** appear on the public GitHub lives in:

```text
/private-servers/anixserver2/   # standalone Express streaming server — git-ignored
```

- `/private-servers/` is in `.gitignore`, and the old tracked `anixserver2/` path has been unstaged from git — so the next push removes server code from GitHub while it keeps working on your machine.
- Run it locally with `cd private-servers/anixserver2 && npm install && npm run dev`.
- The web app never imports it (only points at its deployed URL), so the site builds and runs fine without it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- A free API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AniXDex/AniXFlix.git
   cd AniXFlix
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root (already git-ignored) and add your TMDB key:

   ```env
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_v3_api_key_here
   ```

   > `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY` is accepted as a fallback. Never commit `.env`.

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:3000` 🎉

### Scripts

| Command       | What it does              |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Start dev server          |
| `npm run build` | Production build          |
| `npm run start` | Serve production build    |
| `npm run lint`  | Run ESLint (ignores `private-servers/`, `.next/`, `build/`) |

> After cleanup, run `npm install` once to sync `package-lock.json` with the trimmed dependency list.
